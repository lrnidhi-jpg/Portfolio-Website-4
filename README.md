# Nidhi Rao - Multi-Page Portfolio

This folder contains your static multi-page portfolio website, ready for **Vercel** deployment.

## ðŸš€ Deploy on Vercel

1. Push this folder to a new GitHub repository or upload it directly to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
2. Vercel automatically detects it as a **static site** (no build step needed).
3. The included `vercel.json` ensures clean URLs â€” so `/about` works instead of `/about.html`.
4. Add your custom domain in your Vercel project's **Settings â†’ Domains**.

## ðŸ§± Local Testing
Simply open `index.html` in your browser to test locally.

## ðŸ—‚ Folder Structure
All HTML, CSS, JS, and assets are preserved exactly as uploaded.


## ðŸ§­ 404 Page
A custom 404 page (`404.html`) has been added. When users visit a non-existent page, theyâ€™ll see this instead of a blank error.
